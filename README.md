# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

This starting code for this app was provied by London App Brewery in their Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp course on LinkedIn Learning.

## Our Goal

In this tutorial I learned more Dart programming concepts and how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module I was comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets using functions.


## What I created

A music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
